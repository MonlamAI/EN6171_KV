Three Verses of Supplication to Orgyen, Virūpa, and Mila A Prayer to Virūpa Namo guru virūpāya! Knower of all scriptures, accepted and cared for by the ḍākinīs, Glorious Virūpa, who achieved the state of realization, Chief of the ocean of siddha families, to you I pray- Dispel all obstacles and grant me ordinary and supreme siddhis! At the request of the great vajra holder Kunga Chöwang, Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo made this prayer with the wish that it might become a cause for the blessings of the Lord of Yogis to infuse all others' minds.
